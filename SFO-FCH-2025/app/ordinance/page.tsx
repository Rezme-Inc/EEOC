An Employer may include language such as or similar to: "Background Check Required," but is prohibited from including phrases such as "Must Have Clean Background" or "Must Pass Background Check."

                      Employers who violate the prohibition on inquiring regarding Criminal History prior to making a Conditional Offer of Employment may not use an Applicant or Employee's failure to disclose Criminal History, refusal to answer a question regarding Criminal History, or provision of incomplete or inaccurate information regarding Criminal History in response to the Employer's prohibited inquiry as a basis for a subsequent Adverse Action following a Conditional Offer of Employment, including denying the Applicant or Employee the Employment position or withdrawing, rescinding and/or cancelling a Conditional Offer of Employment.

                    In connection with a Conditional Offer of Employment, if the Employer intends to conduct a review of an Applicant's or Employee's Criminal History information, the Employer must provide notice in writing to the Applicant or Employee that includes the following:

                      A statement that the Employer has good cause to conduct a review of Criminal History for the specific job position with supporting justification provided in writing. A general statement that the Employer is performing a review of Criminal History due to "safety concerns" without more supporting justification is not sufficient to meet this requirement. An Employer establishes good cause if it can demonstrate any of the following:
